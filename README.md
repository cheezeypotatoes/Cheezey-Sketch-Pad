# Cheezey Sketch Pad
## The Odin Project Jquery & JavaScript assignment

This is the final project from [The Odin Project's](www.theodinproject.com) Jquery basics and JavaScript section of the web dev 101 course.


It will allow you to change and erase colors, you can create a custom rgb color as well. Toggle the grid lines to get your drawing more precise. This project was the culmination of about 4 weeks of learning basic web developing tools. I thinks its fun to doodle with, my drawings suck cuz I'm just not artistic like that. I'll bet some people could make some pretty nifty 8-bit looking drawings with some time spent. Take well deserved break from all that coding, you need it every once in a while. Have some fun and make a few cheezey drawings.  This doesn't currently support any way of capturing your drawing and sharing it. I suppose that is a way off still. I'd love to see what you can come up with so you could always screen shot your drawing and email it to someone.
